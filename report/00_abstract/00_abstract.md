# Abstract

Being fatigued is a common state of everyone's daily life. It is a natural
sign of your body that signals you to have a break and rest. However, as soon
as this state of fatigue lasts longer and does not decrease through short

breaks, you could consider yourself being cognitively fatigued. This type of
fatigue persists after long-term cognitive and mental stress. The purpose of
this report is to look at a methodology to use a cross platform application to
determine cognitive fatigue.
