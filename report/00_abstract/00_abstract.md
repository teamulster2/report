# Abstract

Probably everyone knows the feeling of fatigue. It is a natural signal of the human body to show that it needs a break and rest. However, as soon as this state of fatigue lasts longer and does not go back through short breaks, you should think about cognitive fatigue. This is a state of fatigue, that persists after long-term cognitive and mental stress. This report now looks at a methodology to use a cross platform application to determine cognitive fatigue.
