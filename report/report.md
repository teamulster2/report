# Abstract

Being fatigued is a common state of everyone's daily life. It is a
natural sign of your body that signals you to have a break and rest.
However, as soon as this state of fatigue lasts longer and does not go
back through short breaks, you could consider yourself being cognitively
fatigued. This type of fatigue persists after long-term cognitive and
mental stress. The purpose of this report is to look at a methodology to
use a cross platform application to determine cognitive fatigue.

# Introduction

Cognitive fatigue arises from prolonged periods of time in which
mentally demanding tasks are performed that induce a state of subjective
exhaustion, feelings of "tiredness and lack of energy", and decline in
performance \[1\]. It can be said that mental fatigue is felt much more
often after mentally strenuous tasks than after physical exertion.
Examples that can lead to cognitive fatigue are, for example, strenuous
work days without appropriate compensation or processing the tax return
\[2\]. Especially with prolonged mental stress, we often feel drained
and have the feeling that we can no longer continue. A classic example
of this is a long drive. This strains our brain so much that after a
certain time we are no longer able to drive and need a break, although
the body itself did not have to work hard \[2\]. Symptoms of cognitive
fatigue can mainly be described as follows: poor concentration,
forgetfulness, slight irritation, simple tasks seem difficult to solve,
feeling overwhelmed, physical stress symptoms such as headaches, tension
and an increased heart rate, feeling of a mental block, you feel foggy
and sleep is harder \[3\].

Since there is currently no standardized test for recording cognitive
fatigue available and biological markers cannot be used to identify
these \[4\], the task was to write an application that should determine
cognitive fatigue as part of a study on the basis of daily self-tests.

The application should therefore be able to determine the general
condition of a subject with the help of a questionnaire that should be
filled out regularly and replace earlier paper questionnaires and be
able to save it centrally in a database. In addition, a self-test should
be available, which in the best case should be completed several times a
day. This should contain two tasks that check the respondent's reaction
time and memory ability. In addition, with each run of the self-test,
the current emotional state and the current activity of the test person
are recorded so that conclusions can be drawn from them later. This
information is recorded in a database that is to be exchanged regularly
with a server database in order to be able to export all user data
centrally for a study.

# Background

The project was a study project, which was initially relating to an
existing project based on a work from the year 2016 \[4\]. That means
the project is about the implementation of a reusable and expandable
platform in order to be able to carry out studies as part of self-tests
on cognitive fatigue. To do this, the previous application and all of
its properties first had to be examined. From this, some tasks and their
expansion options are already known, to which greater attention can be
paid during implementation.

## Detection of cognitive fatigue

In fact, there are not many ways to recognize cognitive fatigue because
markers cannot be evaluated directly \[4\]. However, two tasks have
emerged that can recognize cognitive fatigue based on the speed of
reaction and the memory of test subjects. On the basis of previous
information from the thesis, two further possibilities are initially not
considered. The use of a questionnaire also plays an important role. So
far, these have only been evaluated on paper and not electronically.

### Psychomotor vigiliance task

A *Psychomotor vigiliance task* (PVT) test is a relatively simple
alternative for detecting cognitive fatigue \[7\]. In PVT tests, the
reaction time and attention span are measured, i.e.Â it is recorded how
quickly the person reacts to an event and whether a reaction occurs at
all. As a rule, such tests can take about 10 minutes \[8\].

### Spatial Span Task

With the help of the *Spatial span task*, the subject's ability to
remember should be tested. For this there is a certain sequence of boxes
that light up and the test person should remember. The subject goes
through different levels, which become more and more difficult \[9\].

### Questionnaire

The questionnaire is the original variant to illustrate cognitive
fatigue. But that was mostly done on paper and then had to be evaluated.
These questions should now be included in the application for
self-evaluation \[4\].

# Methodology

This section deals with the development process and how the project
topic was approached, as well as the decisions made in relation to the
programming languages and environments.

Furthermore, we deal with the architecture of the application, that is
divided into stand-alone client area and a server architecture. The data
exchange and export plays an important role here, which is also
discussed in this chapter and later in the implementation part of the
report.

## Project management

Overall, the project took place within five weeks and five participants
who worked full time on the project. The decisions in the area of
project management are described in more detail below.

### Agile project development with scrum

The project management method SCRUM in a simplified version was chosen
for the project. This had the advantage that, on the one hand,
programming was agile under certain rules, on the other hand some times
and some overhead were reduced.

The Daily Scrum Meeting was an important part of the daily routine,
which was occasionally expanded to talk about the current status and
follow up on the relevant issues. Due to the limited project time of
five weeks, it was decided against the use of sprints and the additional
overhead.

A retrospective meeting was also held once a week, which should contain
the current problems and suggestions for improvement, but also positive
aspects of the project. That helped the project flow and the
satisfaction of the participants.

### Open Source Software

The soTired project emerged as a university project in which all
participants decided to implement an open source solution. This means
that both, so the client application code and the server code are
publicly available under the license \* insert license here \*. This
means that everyone can view the code, edit it and use it for their own
purposes if it can still be made available as an open source solution.
This has the advantage that the study participants can see the code and
which data is used and stored. This ensures data security. In addition,
the code used here is made available to the science and can be further
developed. Since the study project is very limited in time, there are
some areas of the app that can be added and adapted later on. This can
increase the quality of the code in some way.

## Architecture

In this part of the report, the architecture of the application is
described in more detail.

### Architecture overview

Overall, the application is divided into two completely independent
part. On the one hand, there is the stand-alone client app, which
contains the self-test and a questionnaire. On the other hand there is
the server application that gives an export functionality with the user
data.

#### Stand-alone client application

The client app includes the self-test, which is supposed to give
reliable data about the test person several times a day after it has
been carried out. The *Psychomotor vigilance task* and *Spatial span
task* are two tasks included in the self-test. There is also a
questionnaire, which is supposed to record the current condition of the
subject at longer intervals. This happens via a certain number of
questions with four choices each. There should also be a notification
for the self-test, which asks the user up to three times a day to also
carry out the test. In addition, the current mood and current activity
of the test person is saved before each self-test so that the data can
also be reliably interpreted. Last but not least, the client application
also offers a settings page with options for client-server communication
and to control this in a targeted manner.

As the client application is written in *dart* with the *Flutter*
framework you can create multiple cross platform apps out of a single
codebase \[6\]. This means that the client side is not limited to a
single platform or operating system and the code does not have to be
extended for other end devices.

#### Server application

// TODO

### User, client and server communication

For the communication between the user, the client an the server, one
can say that the user only communicates with the client app. The client
app then forwards the data to the server at a suitable time. The first
time the app is used it gets a config file from the server, which
initially load the information for the user. This architecture has the
advantage that the user does not necessarily have to rely on a stable
internet connection when carrying out the self-test or the
questionnaire, and the data can also be transmitted later. At the same
time, the low level of data exchange also ensures that the user only
receives relevant information to save on his own device. In addition,
the user is always aked whether the data should really be transmitted to
the server. In figure 1 you can see the communication between user,
client and server in detail.

![Communication between user, client and
server](../diagrams/implementation/sq_user_client_server.jpg "Communication between user, client and server")

## Database management

The soTired application is known divided into two areas, the stand-alone
client side as well as the server side with options for evaluation and
export. In order to make both areas independent of each other and also
to ensure that the values are always available, even if there is no
network connection at a certain point of use, it was agreed to create
and manage an independet database on both sides.

### Client database

As described above, the client side is written with the helf of the
cross platform framework Flutter and the programming language Dart. Hive
describes itself as a 'Fast, Enjoyable & Secure NoSQL Database' \[5\].
That makes it easy to store database objects in boxes and access them
again. Hive in conjunction with Flutter also promises great support in
terms of use, as this has been specially adapted to it \[5\].

In addition, a NoSQL database was chosen because it is more flexible in
terms of the variety of data in the area of research results and the
speed required for storing such a large amount of data. Espically when
thinking of adding additional functionality like audio or video
recognition and using artificial intelligence to get information out of
that. This is particularly suitable for this, as the data is only saved
and not read out within the app. In this way, all data that is available
can be collected without loss and no information is lost through a rigid
relational form and can be sent to the server side.

### Server database

In contrast to this, a relational database is used on the server side in
order to be able to organize the results and export them later
evaluated, if necessary. We decided on the lightweight, relational
database SQlite that describes itself as an 'small, fast,
self-contained, hight-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine.
This rather traditional, but well-known approach to storing large
amounts of data promises above all a very structured distribution on the
data, from wicht an export can later be made available via a .json file.

Overall, it can be said that the data structure on the server side looks
like described in Figure 2. Therefore the main focus is on the study
with the corresponding information and settings. The users assigned to a
respective study are also stored in a separate table with the associated
primary key for the study. This is where the assignment between user and
study takes place. Then there are two tables that contain the log
structure of the self test and the questionnaire. Inside the log tables
you have all the information that need to be exported afterwards. At the
same time, the questions of a specific study and the associated
questionnaire are saved together with the selectable answers so that
they can be accessed in the study.

![ER diagram](../diagrams/database/ER_diragramm.drawio.png "er-diagram")

## User interface

The user interface in the app should be kept as simple as possible in
order to be accessible to everyone. That means there is a start page
with the logo and four options. From there, the settings lead to a
subpage that provides certain functions for the client-server function.
The study URL can be selected here and data transfer can be ordered
(Figure 3). There is also the sub-item of audio detection, which,
however, has not yet been implemented due to time constraints and the
limitations of the project. The two points above are the self-test and
the questionnaire, which are illustrated in more detail below.

![Home & Settings
Page](../diagrams/implementation/ui_1.png "Home and settings page")

As described in Figure 4, the self test first depicts the current mood
and activity of the test person by asking the test person 2 questions.
To illustrate this, emojis have been used that should be known to
everyone. The PVT test starts immediately after the self-assessment. As
described in Chapter 2, this includes a test of reaction speed and
attention span. Then the spatial span task starts (Figure 5). This in
turn shows the respondent's attention span in which boxes that light up
must be noted. It becomes more and more difficult depending on the
level, as more boxes light up that the test person has to remember.

Some pop-up dialogs were used to display the current game status, which
guide the player through the various tasks. In addition, all tests
contain an overview of the current level and the score. This should give
the user the feeling of knowing where you are in the game and how many
tasks and areas are still to be expected.

Assessment](../diagrams/implementation/ui_3.png "Self Assessment")

![PVT and Spacial span
task](../diagrams/implementation/ui_2.png "PVT and Spacial span task")

Another feature of the app is the questionnaire, which starts
immediately after clicking the button and can be answered intuitively.
There is one question and four options for each question, which can be
staggered. A progress widget is also available, which shows which
question you are currently dealing with.

![Questionnaire](../diagrams/implementation/ui_4.png "Questionnaire")

Overall, the user interface is kept in dark mode and adapted to
smartphones, as the app was initially tested and improved on Android.
Thanks to the cross-platform accessibility, the app can also be accessed
via the web and the areas can be controlled and edited. The color scheme
is kept very subtle in pleasant shades of blue, the primary color is a
bit detached with a light turquoise and is primarily intended to
highlight things. The accent colors represent warmer tones and warning
colors.

# Implementation

The implementation took place on the client side in Dart and Flutter and
on the server side with golang. In the following, the reasons for the
selection of the programming languages ââand frameworks as well as
special features in the code are discussed.

## Flutter application

Flutter is a open source framwork developed by Google. With Flutter you
can create several applications (iOS, Android, web application) with
just one code base. So the development does not take place
platform-specifically, but in one programming language and environment.

The programming language used with Flutter is DART. DART ist a object
oriented programming language that is very similar to C# or Java.

// TODO: Mehr Informationen zu DART / Flutter

All in all we tried to set up a reusable folder and file structure with
some seperation of concerns between the frontend / user interface and
the business logic.

### Config

### Database

### Exceptions

### Notifications

### User Interface

The user interface (ui) part of the code is divided in a core, models
and modules folder.

The core folder contains all files that have to do with the home page
and navigation bar. So everything that has to be reached from everywhere
inside the application.

The modules folder containes all seperate parts that act independently.
So there is a folder and widget for the questionnaire, the spatial span
task, the pvt test and the settings page for example.

Each module contains a dart file with the main Scaffold or Container
that contains all the contents of the specific subpage. Then you have a
widget folder with all seperate smaller parts of the application. So
there is for example a QuestionnaireAnswer widget that is used for each
answer of a specific question.

This precise separation ensures, on the one hand, that the code is much
clearer and should also be less redundant. This avoids repetitions. In
addition, the areas of responsibility are clearly separated from each
other so that errors or changes only have to be carried out once and not
several times. In addition, the individual areas should be easy to find
by other programmers.
