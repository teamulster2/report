# Background

The project is a study project, which refers to an existing
project from the year 2016 [4]. The application evaluated there is a tool for studies on cognitive fatigue based on self-tests. The application presented in the paper on hand is a rewrite of the original application which incorporates results from the previous work.
In order to do this, the previous application and all of its properties first had
to be examined. Based on the examination results some tasks and their
expansion options have been known already. Therefore, greater attention can be
paid during the implementation phase.

## Detection of cognitive fatigue

In fact, there are not many ways to recognize cognitive fatigue because
markers cannot be evaluated directly [4]. However, two tasks (Spatial Span Task and Psychomotor Vigilance Task) have emerged
as reliable indicators. They analyse the speed of reaction and the
memory of test subjects. On the basis of previous information the use of a
questionnaire also plays an important role especially to detect correlations
between a task result  and the test person's self-assessment .

### Psychomotor vigiliance task

A *Psychomotor vigiliance task* (PVT) test is a relatively simple alternative
for detecting cognitive fatigue [7]. In PVT tests, the reaction time and
attention span are measured, i.e. it is recorded how quickly the person reacts
to an event and whether a reaction occurs at all. As a rule, such tests can
take about 10 minutes [8].

### Spatial span task

With the help of the *Spatial span task*, the subject's ability to remember
should be tested. In order to perform the test, the user will be displayed a
certain sequence of boxes that light up and that he or she should remember.
The subject goes through different levels, which become more and more
difficult [9].

### Questionnaire

The questionnaire is based on the original version to illustrate cognitive
fatigue. But that was mostly done on paper and then had to be evaluated.
These questions should now be included in the application for self-evaluation
[4].
