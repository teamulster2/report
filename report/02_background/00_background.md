# Background

The project was a study project, which was initially relating to an existing
project based on a work from the year 2016 [4]. This means that the project
is about the implementation of a reusable and expandable platform in order to
be able to carry out studies as part of self-tests on cognitive fatigue. In
order to do this, the previous application and all of its properties first had
to be examined. Based on the examination results some tasks and their
expansion options have been known already. Therefore, greater attention can be
paid during the implementation phase.

## Detection of cognitive fatigue

In fact, there are not many ways to recognize cognitive fatigue because
markers cannot be evaluated directly [4]. However, two tasks have emerged
that can recognize cognitive fatigue based on the speed of reaction and the
memory of test subjects. On the basis of previous information from the
thesis, two further possibilities are not considered initially. The use of a
questionnaire also plays an important role. So far, these have only been
evaluated on paper and not electronically.

### Psychomotor vigiliance task

A *Psychomotor vigiliance task* (PVT) test is a relatively simple alternative
for detecting cognitive fatigue [7]. In PVT tests, the reaction time and
attention span are measured, i.e. it is recorded how quickly the person reacts
to an event and whether a reaction occurs at all. As a rule, such tests can
take about 10 minutes [8].

### Spatial Span Task

With the help of the *Spatial span task*, the subject's ability to remember
should be tested. In order to perform the test, the user will be displayed a
certain sequence of boxes that light up and that he or she should remember.
The subject goes through different levels, which become more and more
difficult [9].

### Questionnaire

The questionnaire is based on the original version to illustrate cognitive
fatigue. But that was mostly done on paper and then had to be evaluated.
These questions should now be included in the application for self-evaluation
[4].
