## Project management

Overall, the project took place within five weeks and five participants who
worked full time on the project. The decisions in the area of project
management are described in more detail below.

### Agile project development with scrum

The project management method SCRUM in a simplified version was chosen for the
project. This had the advantage that, on one hand, programming was agile
under certain rules and on the other hand time management could be optimized,
while overheads could be reduced.
Repeating Scrum meetings were an important part of the daily routine which was
occasionally expanded to talk about the current status and follow up on
relevant issues. Due to the limited project time of five weeks, it was
decided against the use of sprints and the additional overhead. 

A retrospective meeting was also held once a week where current problems
regarding the development process could be addressed and improvement
suggestions were made. Nevertheless, positive aspects were not neglected
either. This complemented the project workflow and the satisfaction of the
participants.
Each team member was assigned a role which he was responsible for. The roles
were e.g. 'Moderator', 'Scrum master' or 'GitHub repository moderator'.


### Open Source Software

The soTired project emerged as a university project in which all participants
decided to implement an open source solution. This means that both, the
client application source code and the server source code are publicly
available under the license *GNU Affero General Public License v3.0*. Public
repositories result in the fact that everyone can view the source code, edit
it and use it for their own purposes if it still follows the rules of the
original license. This has the advantage that the study participants can see
the code and which data is used and stored. Because of this data security is
ensured. Additionally, all of soTired's source code is made available to
science projects and can be further developed. Since the study project is
very limited in time, there are some areas of the app that can be added and
adapted later on. This may increase code quality.
