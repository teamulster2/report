## Project management

Overall, the project took place within five weeks and five participants who worked full time on the project. The decision in the area of project management are described in more detail below.

### Agile project development with scrum

The project management method SCRUM in a simplified version was chosen for the project. This had the advantage that, on the one hand, programming was agile under certain rules, on the other hand some times and some overhead were reduced.

The Daily Scrum Meeting was an important part of the daily routine, which was occasionally expanded to talk about the current status and follow up on the relevant issues. Due to the limited project time of five weeks, it was decided against the use of sprints and the additional overhead. 

A retrospective meeting was also held once a week, which should contain the current problems and suggestions for improvement, but also positive aspects of the project. That helped the project flow and the satisfaction of the participants.


### Open Source Software

The soTired project emerged as a university project in which all participants decided to implement an open source solution. This means that both, so the client application code and the server code are publicly available under the license * insert license here *. This means that everyone can view the code, edit it and use it for their own purposes if it can still be made available as an open source solution. This has the advantage that the study participants can see the code and which data is used and stored. This ensures data security. In addition, the code used here is made available to the science and can be further developed. Since the study project is very limited in time, there are some areas of the app that can be added and adapted later on. This can increase the quality of the code in some way.
