# Methodology

This section deals with the development process and how the project topic was
approached, as well as the decisions made regarding the programming
languages and environments.

Furthermore, we deal with the architecture of the application, that is divided
into stand-alone client area and a server architecture. The data exchange and
export plays an important role, which is also discussed in this chapter
as well as in the implementation part of the report.
