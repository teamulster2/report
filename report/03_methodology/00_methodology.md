# Methodology

This section deals with the development process and how the project topic was approached, as well as the decisions made in relation to the programming languages and environments.

Furthermore, we deal with the architecture of the application, that is divided into stand-alone client area and a server architecture. 
The data exchange and export plays an important role here, which is also discussed in this chapter and later in the implementation part of the report.
