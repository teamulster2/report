# Conclusion

All in all, the developed application with its focus on platform-independence
and interchangeability provides a solid basis for further studies on the 
fatigue assessment topic. Additionally the application based approach brings
the advantage of convenient data collection and representation in order to be
analysed.
Basically, all major functions from the original iOS application described in 
the paper [4] along with the  given user feedback were taken over with 
well-considered adjustments.

In order to generate added value for study purposes, we would recommend 
some further developing, especially in the administration area. 
In addition, analysis tools would have to be created based on our 
export functions, that can provide reliable results for study purposes.

Another suggestion that arose during the design phase was audio or 
video recognition. For this purpose, a model would have to be created 
and trained that recognizes changes in the facial expression or voice 
of a test person. In combination with the results from the self-test 
and the questionnaire, it should then be possible to produce even more 
reliable results relating to the detection of cognitive fatigue.
