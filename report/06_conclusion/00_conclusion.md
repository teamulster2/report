# Conclusion

All in all, the application and the client-server structure add value 
to the application based approach to detect cognitive fatigue because 
it is platform-independent and interchangeable. Basically, all important 
functions of the previous iOS application designed in the paper [4] were 
taken over after brief adjustments.

In order to generate added value for study purposes, we would recommend 
some further developing, especially in the administration area. 
In addition, analysis tools would have to be created based on our 
export functions, that can provide reliable results for study purposes.

Another suggestion that arose during the design phase was audio or 
video recognition. For this purpose, a model would have to be created 
and trained that recognizes changes in the facial expression or voice 
of a test person. In interaction with the results from the self-test 
and the questionnaire, it should then be possible to produce even more 
reliable results relating to the detection of cognitive fatigue.
